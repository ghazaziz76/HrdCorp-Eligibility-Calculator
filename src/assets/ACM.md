**Notes:**
- C vs D mutual exclusivity: each person claims C (travel) OR D (meal) — not both. Host trainees → D. Branch/sub trainees → C.
- External trainer may claim C only — not D.
- Overseas trainer gets E (daily allowance), not D (meal).
- A and B prorated when total pax < 5.
- Extra travel day: staff ≥100km may claim +1 extra day at Row C rate (full day training only).
- Subsidiary present (HCC/SBL): public rate (RM1,750/pax/day) applies for both external and overseas trainer. Each company pays per their own pax.
- SLB cost mode: group rate ÷ total pax × each employer's pax. Never switches to public rate.
- SLB consumables: organising employer only.
- SLB: overseas trainer not applicable.
- Max pax per group (Employer's Circular No. 3/2024): Non-Technical = 50 pax × number of trainers; Technical = 25 pax × number of trainers. **This is a hard limit — exceeding it blocks the grant application. Reduce participants or add trainers.**
- **Actual Course Fee (External/Overseas trainer):** Enter the actual fee from the brochure or offer letter. If actual fee ≤ ACM ceiling → system claims actual fee. If actual fee > ACM ceiling → system claims up to ACM ceiling only; excess is a self-funded deficit. Leave blank → system uses ACM ceiling rate.

# PART C — CROSS-CUTTING RULES

## TABLE 9 — Rules Applying to All Training Types

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| C vs D mutual exclusivity | Each person claims C (travel) OR D (meal) — not both |
| External trainer personal claim | Ext. trainer may claim C (travel) only — not D (meal) |
| External trainer — air ticket | Eligible only when: (a) branch/sub trainees are present (long-distance training context), OR (b) venue is external hotel. At own premise with no branches/subs, external trainer is treated as local — no air ticket entitlement |
| Overseas trainer — air ticket | Always eligible — trainer flew in from overseas regardless of venue or participant composition |
| Extra travel day — local | Staff ≥100km: +1 extra day at Row C rate (full day training only) |
| Extra travel days — overseas | Up to +2 extra days of daily allowance (RM1,500/day × 50%) |
| 75% attendance | Min 75% attendance required. Allowances prorated by attendance |
| Half-day minimum | 4 hours minimum = half day. All items at half-day rate |
| Prorating — less than 5 pax | A and B: (rate ÷ 5) × actual pax |
| Subsidiary present (HCC/SBL) | Course fee switches from group rate to RM1,750/pax/day for both external and overseas trainer. Each company pays per own pax. **Subsidiaries only affect the course fee calculation and split. All other allowable costs (travel, meal, air ticket) are calculated for the Host Company and its Branches only.** Each subsidiary must submit their own separate HRD Corp grant application to claim travel, meal, and air ticket allowances. |
| SLB cost split | Group rate ÷ total pax × each employer's pax. Never public rate. Each participating employer is entered via the "+ Add Participating Employer" button — requires Employer Name, HRD Corp Employer Code, and Pax count. |
| SLB consumables | Organising employer only |
| Public / overseas pax cap | Max 9 pax per employer. Pax 10+ self-funded |
| Seminar min pax | In-house event: 51 total. Public event: 51 per TP |
| LTM | In-house training only. Requires HRD Corp Special Approval Letter at grant stage |
| Max pax — Non-Technical in-house | **Hard limit**: 50 pax × number of trainers (Employer's Circular No. 3/2024). Exceeding this blocks the claim. In-house training only — NOT applicable to Public Training or Seminar/Conference |
| Max pax — Technical in-house | **Hard limit**: 25 pax × number of trainers (Employer's Circular No. 3/2024). Exceeding this blocks the claim. In-house training only — NOT applicable to Public Training or Seminar/Conference |
| Audit risk threshold | >25 pax: HRD Corp may request audit documentation |
| Actual Course Fee input | Applies when trainer type is External or Overseas (in-house, ROT). Enter the actual fee from the brochure/offer letter. If actual ≤ ACM ceiling → system claims actual fee. If actual > ACM ceiling → system claims only ACM ceiling; deficit is self-funded by employer. Leave blank → system uses ACM ceiling only. For Internal trainer, this field is not shown (trainer allowance is a fixed ACM rate, not a quoted provider fee). |
| Deficit display — per company | When subsidiaries are present and the ACM ceiling is applied, the deficit is shown at both the total level AND per individual company row (Host Company / each Subsidiary). Each company row shows: HRD Corp pays RMxxx / 💰 Deficit RMxxx to be funded from employer's own budget. Deficit per company = (actual fee/pax − ACM ceiling/pax) × that company's pax count. |
