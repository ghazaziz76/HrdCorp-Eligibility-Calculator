The difference between Remote Online Training and e-Learning under HRDCorp is primarily about delivery mode, supervision, interaction structure, and claim classification. Many people confuse them. HRDCorp does not.

Remote Online Training is synchronous.
e-Learning is typically asynchronous.

That distinction affects compliance, documentation, and allowable cost treatment.

Remote Online Training refers to live virtual sessions conducted in real time. The trainer delivers the programme at a scheduled time through platforms such as Zoom or Microsoft Teams. The sample must log in at a fixed hour. Interaction occurs live. Attendance is recorded in real time. The structure mirrors classroom training except the venue is digital.

e-Learning, on the other hand, usually refers to self-paced modules hosted on an LMS or platform. There is no live trainer conducting the session at that moment. The learner completes modules independently within an assigned timeframe. Progress tracking is system generated rather than trainer monitored.
Under HRDCorp, “Remote Online Training” refers to structured training programmes delivered live through digital platforms, where the trainer and the sample are not physically present in the same venue. It is distinct from face to face classroom training and also distinct from purely self paced e learning.

To understand it properly, you need to differentiate three categories under HRDCorp practice.

First, conventional training. This is physical, venue based, trainer and respondents in the same location.

Second, remote online training. This is synchronous. The trainer conducts the session in real time via platforms such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Webex, or similar systems. Interaction occurs live. Attendance is tracked. Engagement is monitored. It follows a fixed schedule, just like classroom training, but conducted virtually.

Third, self paced digital learning or computer based training. This is asynchronous. The learner logs in and completes modules independently without a live trainer conducting the session at that moment.

Remote online training falls squarely into the second category.

From HRDCorp’s Allowable Cost Matrix perspective, remote online training is treated similarly to physical training in terms of claimability, but with some cost components adjusted. For example:

Trainer fee remains claimable.

Course fee remains claimable.

Venue cost is generally not applicable.

Daily allowance may be treated differently depending on location and scheme.

Flight tickets and accommodation are typically not relevant unless hybrid arrangements exist.
